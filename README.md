👩‍💻 I'm Quinn, a recent Computer Science grad with a personal interest in mobile development and art. My latest project is an 𝐚𝐫𝐭-𝐣𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐎𝐒 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 that enables artists to record the evolving process of art creation.

👯 Aside from coding, I am dedicated to using 𝐚𝐫𝐭 as a means to 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 and 𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐰𝐞𝐥𝐥-𝐛𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬. In college, I pursued this passion as a resident assistant and as the Cultural House Coordinator of the Asian Student Association.

⭐️ Fun fact: I love modding mechanical keyboards. My current project is the Keychron C1!
